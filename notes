1. Client requests new chatroom (look at cooperate defect)
	- Server receives request something like :app.post('/makeChatroom/', function(req, res)
	- Server will generate a chatroom, which is basically just a randomnumber and it will redirect the person to http:// localhost:3333/chatRoom/randomNumber

2. Client 2 is given localhost:3333/chatRoom/randomNumber by client 1 and goes on it from a browser
	- So server handles this : app.get('/chatRoom/:id', function(req, res)
